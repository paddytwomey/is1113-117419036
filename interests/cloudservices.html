		 <p>
		 A cloud service is any service made available to users on demand via the Internet from a cloud computing provider's servers as opposed to being provided from a company's own on-premises servers. Cloud services are designed to provide easy, scalable access to applications, resources and services, and are fully managed by a cloud services provider.
         </p>
         <p>
         A cloud service can dynamically scale to meet the needs of its users, and because the service provider supplies the hardware and software necessary for the service, thereâ€™s no need for a company to provision or deploy its own resources or allocate IT staff to manage the service.  Examples of cloud services include online data storage and backup solutions, Web-based e-mail services, hosted office suites and document collaboration services, database processing, managed technical support services and more.
